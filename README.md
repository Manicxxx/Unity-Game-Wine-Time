# Unity Game "Wine Time"

In this rather funny meant game you have the task to find and drink wine until you reach an alcohol level so that a cab will pick you up and drive you back home.

A more detailed description of the working process can be found in the corresponding pdf-file in this repository.

A short demo video of the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbBny-5l-pA&ab_channel=Manicx).
